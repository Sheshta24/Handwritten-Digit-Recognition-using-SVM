## Handwritten Digit Recognition using Custom SVM with RBF Kernel

### Project Overview

This project involves the implementation of a custom Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel to recognize handwritten digits. The MNIST dataset, a large collection of handwritten digits, is used for training and testing the model. The primary objective is to explore and understand the mechanisms behind SVMs and the application of the RBF kernel in classification tasks.

### Features

Custom SVM implementation with an RBF kernel.
One-vs-Rest (OvR) approach for handling multi-class classification.
Utilization of the MNIST dataset for model training and evaluation.
Data preprocessing with feature scaling.

### Requirements

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

NumPy
scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages (if not already installed):
`pip install numpy scikit-learn matplotlib`

### Usage

1. Run the script to train and test the SVM model:
`python svm_mnist.py`
2. The program will output the accuracy of the custom SVM model on the MNIST test dataset.

### Contributing

Contributions to improve the model or extend its functionality are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
